Heyo!

My name is Jinhyuk Kim, but I usually go by Jin. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Earth System Science Department at the University of 
California, Irvine. My research is primarily focused on the global carbon cycle, with an emphasis on terrestrial ecosystems. I am paritucarly interested in how changes to the plant communities influence physical climate and carbon fluxes.
